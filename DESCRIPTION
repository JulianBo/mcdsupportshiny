Description: Using Shiny, a graphical user interface is created where users can weight 
    differenct criteria in relation to each other. Those weighted criteria are then used
    to find the best among several supplied alternatives. Alternatives and criteria are 
    supplied according to your decision problem, so that this package can be used for
    different cases. While the majority of criteria must be quantified, the importance of 
    non-quantifiable criteria can also be asessed. The application is ready for multi-user 
    contexts. The weights of users can be stored and evaluated within the program.
